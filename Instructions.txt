Additional Notes

Make sure your WiFi adapter is set up properly:

Put the adapter in monitor mode if using deauth attacks (e.g., airmon-ng start wlan0)

Confirm interface names (e.g., wlan0, wlan0mon) and update app.py accordingly.


If you donâ€™t want to run the entire app with sudo, configure sudoers to allow running iwlist and aireplay-ng without password prompts:


sudo visudo

Add lines like:

yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/iwlist, /usr/sbin/aireplay-ng

Replace yourusername with your actual Linux username and paths to the commands with which iwlist and which aireplay-ng outputs.
